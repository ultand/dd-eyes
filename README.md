# dd-eyes
A package to simulate Direct Detection (DD) eye diagrams.

DD-Eyes will have the ability to plot eye-diagrams for common modulation formats with provided signal to noise ratios.

The measured BER is returned in addition to the expected BER from theory.

# Roadmap for v 0.1.x
- Generate a two level signal (NRZ)
- Add noise associated with a provided SNR
- Simulate time changes with an associated maximum bandwidth
- simulate jitter
- Provide statistics on simulated and expected BER
